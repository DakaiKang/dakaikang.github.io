I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at ExpoLab, UC Davis, where I became a Ph.D. candidate in November 2024 after passing the Qualifying Examination. I conduct my research under the supervision of [Prof. Sadoghi](https://expolab.org). My work focuses on designing and building high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed systems that operate reliably under adversarial conditions. My recent research interests include high-performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols, fair transaction ordering, transaction scheduling, and parallel transaction execution in adversarial environments. I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University in 2022.

## Open-Source Project

I conduct my research on our resilient data platform **[ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.incubator.apache.org)** [[blog](https://blog.resilientdb.com), [codebase](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb)], a distributed ledger that centers around a democratic and decentralized computational model, with the goal of unifying secure transactional and real-time analytical processing. ResilientDB is currently under Apache Incubation. Since 2022, alongside my talented peer Junchao, we have re-architected and re-imagined its modular system design from the ground up. Our design embeds parallelism and deep pipelining at every layer to fully harness modern hardware and cloud infrastructure globally.
