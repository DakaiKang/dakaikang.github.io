I am a first-year Ph.D. Computer Science student at [ExpoLab](https://expolab.org), UC Davis. My Principal Investigator is [Prof.Sadoghi](https://expolab.org). My main research interest is BFT consensus protocols, especially HotStuff variants and concurrent consensus protocols. My latest research outcome is a high-throughput Practical View-Change-Less Protocol (PVP) that enables primary rotation, fast view synchronization, and concurrent consensus.

## Research

I conduct my research on our resilient data platform **[ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.com)** [[blog](https://blog.resilientdb.com), [codebase](https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb)], a distributed ledger centered around a democratic and decentralized computational model that further aims to unify secure transactional and real-time analytical processing. PVP was implemented in the history version of ResilientDB and I finished all experiments there. Now we gradually switch to working on a brand new version called '**[NexRes](https://resilientdb.com)**'. Led by my outstanding co-work Junchao, in NexRes, we have re-architected and re-imagined modular system design from scratch that embeds parallelism and deep pipelining at every layer to fully exploit modern hardware and cloud infrastructure globally. We have a strong NexRes team and I am responsible for concurrent consensus protocols and recovery in NexRes.
